## 👋 About Me

I’m a **senior software engineer with 15+ years of hands-on PHP experience** and **5+ years working extensively with Laravel**.
I’ve built systems ranging from e-commerce and logistics platforms to fintech, crypto and real-time communication products.

Currently, I work **remotely as an IT Manager**, where I focus on **challenging problems**, system design, and pushing teams toward cleaner, more scalable solutions.  
Routine tasks don’t excite me — **complex, constraint-heavy challenges do**.

## ☁️ DevOps & Cloud

I’m deeply comfortable with **system design and network topology**, not just “deploying apps”.

- **AWS** (primary) & **Azure**
- **Docker** & containerized architectures
- **Kubernetes**, horizontal scaling, load balancing
- **Helm**, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation
- Monitoring, logging and performance-driven setups

I enjoy designing systems that **scale cleanly and fail gracefully**.

## 🚀 What I’m Exploring

- **Go** & **Rust** (actively learning)
- **LLMs**  
  Fine-tuning models, experimenting with **AI agents** and automation workflows.
- New technologies that solve *real* problems, not hype-driven ones.

## 🤝 Work Philosophy

- Remote-first
- Prefer **challenging, high-impact problems**
- Strong believer in clean architecture, ownership and pragmatic engineering
- Comfortable leading technical decisions and mentoring teams
